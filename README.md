# Automated Commit
This is me messing around with bash and I wanted to see if I can automate git commits.

## It needs the ff to run:
- node
- git

## To use 
1. All you need is to run the customCommit.sh either using the terminal or clicking the file
2. It'll prompt to enter values for year, month and day should you choose to do so. If you don't enter anything, it will use the current date respectively.
3. No error checking has been made for this version yet. It might break should you enter a date that doesn't follow the format.
4. You'll need to set up a repository online, if you also want to automate the `git push` 

## Next Feature
I'll be looking into adding a feature where you can determine how many times it will make commits.
